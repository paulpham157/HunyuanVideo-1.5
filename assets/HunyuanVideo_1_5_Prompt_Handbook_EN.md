## I. Basic Features
### Text-to-Video
**Feature Overview**: Input a text description, and the model will generate the corresponding video. To control the visual output more precisely, we strongly recommend using structured prompts. You can combine multiple "keywords" just like a pro.
**Core Formula**: Prompt = Subject + Motion + Scene + [Shot Type] + [Camera Movement] + [Lighting] + [Style] + [Atmosphere]. A good prompt can be freely composed of the components above. The items in brackets [] are optional.

* **Basic Usage**: Subject + Motion + Scene

* **Advanced Usage**: Freely add more control tags, e.g., Subject + Motion + Scene + Style + Camera Movement + Lighting

To her right, a woman with long black hair is in a soft pink top. All three have joyful expressions and are smiling warmly. On the table in front of them are three elegant glasses filled with translucent red wine, their forms defined by soft, flowing colors. Initially, the women's hands, rendered with light, expressive strokes, are near their glasses. Then, they simultaneously reach out, grasp the stems of their wine glasses, and begin to lift them from the table. Next, they smoothly raise the glasses towards the center of the frame in a celebratory gesture, their movements fluid and graceful. Finally, the three glasses gently meet in the middle for a toast, the liquid inside swirling slightly with the motion. The background is an abstract wash of warm yellows and soft browns, suggesting a cozy indoor environment without specific details, characteristic of a wet-on-wet watercolor technique. The light source is diffuse and from the front, casting gentle, soft-edged shadows. The paper texture is subtly visible, with faint water stains at the edges of the color washes, enhancing the authentic watercolor aesthetic. The shot is at an eye-level angle with the main subjects. The camera remains static. The entire scene is defined by its distinct watercolor style, featuring translucent color layers, delicate ink outlines, and visible pigment bleeding. The mood is joyful and celebratory. The overall video presents a classic illustration watercolor style.``` </details>|

Initially, the fire burns exceptionally brightly, with vivid orange and yellow flames licking upward in a realistic and fluid manner. The letters are clearly visible, emitting a dazzling glow and casting dynamic, flickering light and shadow. Subsequently, a strong gust of wind blows in from the left, causing the flames to violently sway to the right and begin to break apart. Immediately following, the flame structure of "hunyuan" completely disintegrates, dissolving into a swirling cluster of orange-red sparks and embers that drift to the right. Every wisp of ember trails a faint line of smoke, forming a scene full of motion and particle effects. Finally, as the embers sweep across the screen and gradually dim, they briefly coalesce to form the outline of the Chinese characters "混元". This newly formed character shape emits one last fading red glow before extinguishing completely, returning the frame to total darkness.``` </details> |<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b042d8-5db3-4c26-b210-a6353570d44c" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```A giant neon sign with the text "Hunyuan Video 1.5" sequentially illuminates on a wet cyberpunk street corner at night.The scene is a rain-slicked, dimly lit street corner in a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk city at night. Mounted on the side of a dark, metallic building is a giant sign, its unlit glass neon tubes forming the words "Hunyuan Video 1.5" against a dark framework. Initially, the street is dark, with only faint ambient light reflecting off the wet asphalt. Then, the camera begins to slowly zoom in toward the sign. As it moves closer, the first letter, "H," flickers to life with a vibrant, pinkish-purple glow, accompanied by the visual suggestion of faint electrical sparks. Next, the remaining letters and numbers—'u', 'n', 'y', 'u', 'a', 'n', ' ', 'V', 'i', 'd', 'e', 'o', ' ', '1', '.', '5'—ignite in quick, fluid succession. Finally, the entire sign is brilliantly illuminated, casting a strong, vivid pink and purple light that spreads downwards, bathing the wet street below in its powerful cyberpunk radiance.The background is filled with the quintessential elements of a cyberpunk urban aesthetic. In the distance, the dark silhouettes of towering, monolithic skyscrapers are punctuated by scattered, blinking lights and faint, oversized holographic advertisements. Steam billows up from a grated vent on the sidewalk near the corner, catching the new light from the sign. The wet street surface acts as a dark mirror, creating sharp, elongated reflections of the now-blazing "Hunyuan Video 1.5" sign. The overall atmosphere is moody and distinctly futuristic.The shot is at a slightly low angle, making the sign feel imposing and monumental. The camera zooms in smoothly. The lighting is dynamic, transitioning from a dark, ambient scene to one dominated by the high-contrast, emissive light of the neon sign. The color palette is defined by deep blues, blacks, and the vibrant pinkish-purple of the neon. The overall video presents a cinematic photography realistic style with a strong cyberpunk aesthetic.``` </details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19c981a6-336e-49bd-969d-f9f7baaff95a" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```A single drop of ink blooms on traditional Chinese Xuan paper, forming a majestic landscape painting, which then fluidly reorganizes into the calligraphic text "Hunyuan Video 1.5".The scene opens on a flat, off-white sheet of traditional Chinese Xuan paper, its subtle, fibrous texture visible under soft, even top-down lighting. Initially, a single drop of concentrated, jet-black ink falls into a clear pool of water at the center of the paper. It immediately blossoms outward with stunning speed, the ink diffusing in elegant, smoke-like plumes. The bleeding edges create a beautiful gradient of tones, from deep black to pale gray, a classic feature of ink wash painting. Next, as the ink spreads, it miraculously forms the silhouette of a majestic Chinese landscape. Tall, layered mountain peaks take shape, shrouded in ethereal mist created by the paper's negative space. In the lower portion of the ink wash, the simple shape of a solitary boat appears on the water's surface. Then, the static image comes to life; the ink composing the mountains and boat dissolves into flowing, liquid streams that gracefully swirl and migrate across the paper towards the upper center. Finally, these streams converge and solidify, artfully forming the characters "Hunyuan Video 1.5" in a refined, calligraphic brushstroke style.``` </details>|

**e. To make the video generation more accurate and dynamic, it is recommended to follow these requirements to make prompts more specific and responsive**:
* Dynamics and Sequentiality
    * Rule: Describe the visual as a process with a time sequence, using conjunctions to clarify steps.
    * Recommended Sentence Structure: First... then... next... meanwhile... finally...
    * Demo: The girl first arranges her hair, then turns to walk toward the door, and finally stops in front of the door to look back at the camera.
* Objective Description of Details
  * Rule: Reduce the use of abstract emotional words and convert them into "action details."
  * Formula: Subject + Action + Small Detail
  * Demo: The boy smiles, eyes crinkling slightly.
* Precision of Space and Orientation
  * Rule: Use simple directional words to clarify "who is where" and "moving where."
  * Directional Vocabulary: Left/Right side of the frame, Top/Bottom, Center, Foreground/Background.
  * Demo: A hand reaches out from the right side of the frame, touches the tag on the black clothes, and then leaves the frame from the bottom.
* Clear Reference/Attribution
  * Rule: When there are multiple characters in the frame (including input images for Image-to-Video), it is recommended to distinguish individuals by attributes or position to avoid confusion.
  * Demo: The black cat hands the bomb to the gray cat; the gray cat takes the bomb and turns to run toward the right side of the frame.

## III. More Creative Usage and Cases

Her messy hair is blown by the wind, and she slightly raises her head, looking up at the sky with a very sorrowful expression, tears welling in her eyes, one tear sliding down her cheek. Her lips are painted with red lipstick. The background features an ornate red floral pattern. The scene presents a retro cinematic style, with low saturation tones and a slight soft focus to enhance the emotional atmosphere. The texture resembles classic film from the 1990s, creating a nostalgic yet dramatic feeling.``` </details> |<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd29b6b8-62dd-4aa6-b3ee-5a109d1a7cc8" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```In an empty modern loft, an architectural blueprint is spread out on the center of the floor. Suddenly, the lines on the blueprint begin to glow faintly, as if awakened by some unseen force. Immediately following, the glowing lines start to extend upward, breaking free from the flat surface and outlining three-dimensional contours—like a silent 3D print happening in the air. Subsequently, the miracle accelerates: a minimalist oak desk, an elegant Eames-style leather chair, a tall industrial metal bookshelf, and several Edison bulbs rapidly "grow" with light patterns as their skeleton. In the blink of an eye, the lines are filled with real textures—the warmth of wood, the feel of leather, the coolness of metal—all completely rendered. Finally, all the furniture firmly settles onto the floor, and the blueprint's light quietly fades. A complete office space is thus born from the two-dimensional drawing.``` </details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d23d803-4acc-41ac-ae3e-84fd31b5794a" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```Cinematic 4K macro videography, presented in a hyper-realistic style. A tight, static shot reveals a scene bathed in the focused glow of a single, warm-toned overhead lamp, which casts deep, soft shadows. Upon a soft grey felt jeweler's mat rests an exquisite mechanical clockwork beetle, its carapace fashioned from polished brass and its tiny legs from gleaming silver. Through translucent panels, a complex array of minuscule, ruby-red gears and cogs are visible. A pair of impossibly fine, steel tweezers, held with surgical steadiness, descends into the frame. With breathtaking precision and in extreme slow motion, the tweezers begin a delicate disassembly, first gripping and unscrewing a microscopic brass screw. The screw turns with deliberate slowness, its threads catching the light. The tweezer then lifts the carapace away, revealing the full, intricate clockwork mechanism whirring silently within. One by one, the tweezers pluck individual ruby gears from their mountings; each component lifts away smoothly, its polished teeth glinting, before being placed gently on the felt beside the beetle's inert body. This hyper-realistic footage captures every subtle specular highlight on the metal and the soft, light-absorbing texture of the felt, creating a powerful study in precision engineering and meticulous deconstruction.``` </details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa18b171-cd80-4fa9-80da-5cf5e762b6cb" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```A sweet anime girl in a 'HunyuanVideo 1.5' sweater makes a heart gesture with her hands.

Across the chest area of her sweater, the text "HunyuanVideo 1.5" is clearly and neatly printed in a clean, black sans-serif font. Her expression is cheerful and endearing. Initially, the girl stands facing the camera with a gentle smile, her hands positioned in front of her chest, slightly apart. Then, she smoothly brings her hands together, touching her thumbs to form the bottom point of a heart and curving her index and middle fingers to create the top arches. As the heart shape is completed, her smile widens, and she gives a playful wink with her right eye. She is situated in the center of a softly lit room. The background is blurred with a shallow depth of field, suggesting a clean, minimalist interior with a warm, gentle, and comfortable feel.

He wears a pair of professional, matte-black headphones, one earcup slightly removed, revealing a focused expression and a brow beaded with sweat from his intense concentration. He wears a black bomber jacket, zipped open to reveal a T-shirt underneath. His upper body sways back and forth rhythmically to the throbbing electronic beats, his head moving with precise movement. The mixing console in front of him serves as the primary source of light. In the distance, the cool white glow of several stadium floodlights casts a deep, dark haze across the vast field, casting long shadows across the emerald green grass, creating a stark contrast to the brightly lit area surrounding the DJ booth. His hands danced swiftly and precisely across the equipment, one hand steadily pushing and pulling a long volume fader, while the fingers of the other nimbly jumped between the illuminated knobs and pads, sometimes decisively cutting a bass line, sometimes triggering an echo effect. The entire scene was filled with high-tech dynamics and the solitary creative passion. Against the backdrop of the vast and silent night stadium, it created an atmosphere of high focus, energy, and a slightly surreal feeling.``` </details> |<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7743347-a5ae-4d2e-b172-6fc9530eadc9" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```蛋糕人坐在椅子上，随后，他用手从自己的腿上掰下一块蛋糕，掉落了一些蛋糕碎屑，腿上显示出蛋糕的缺口。接着，他将掰下的蛋糕块举到嘴边，张开嘴咬了一口，咀嚼了几下。背景中的桌子和墙壁保持静止。``` </details><details><summary>📷 Input image</summary> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b029ba-1cda-49f7-806e-db4df044cd14" width="600"></img></details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ea0214-f949-479a-b9af-20d66286c295" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```The camera remains static. A massive tiger in the center of the frame runs toward the camera, its four limbs powerfully pushing off the ground, its orange and black stripes slightly shimmering in the sunlight with the ripple of its muscles. A small boy wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt sits on the tiger's back, his hands resting lightly on the sides of the tiger's neck, his feet hanging naturally down the tiger's sides, his face smiling, his mouth curved upward, and his eyes slightly squinted against the wind of the run. The background is a dense forest, with tall, moss-covered trees. Sunlight slants down through the canopy gaps, forming beams of light, and as the tiger runs, the light spots slowly shift across the ground and leaves. Foreground fern leaves gently sway due to the airflow, and dew drops slide from the leaf tips. As the tiger runs, its tail sways side to side, its gait is steady, and every step kicks up faint dust. Within five seconds, the tiger and the boy continuously approach the camera, eventually dominating most of the frame, with the camera remaining fixed, highlighting the fusion of the subject's dynamism and the environmental atmosphere.``` </details>|

Subsequently, SpongeBob's right hand slowly extends forward from the screen image, breaking through the screen plane and entering the foreground space. He holds a complete Krabby Patty in his hand; the lettuce, patty, cheese, and sauce of the burger are clearly layered, sesame seeds are sprinkled on the top bun, and steam gently rises from the burger's seams. His hand moves smoothly, his wrist slightly turns, gently placing the Krabby Patty into the palm of a real human hand in the foreground. The palm is naturally open, its skin texture clearly visible, and after the Krabby Patty touches the palm, the hand slightly depresses due to the weight. Subsequently, SpongeBob's hand slowly retracts, moving upward from the foreground, finally pulling back completely into the screen and returning to the kitchen scene.``` </details> <details><summary>📷 Input image</summary> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77c53ac6-69af-469a-8246-f4428a717e98" width="600"></img></details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2789eb3d-7697-4abe-b6e7-47daf50723d7" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```镜头静止不动，随后缓缓向前推进，聚焦于前景中一只真实的人手与背景电脑屏幕上的卡通人物水冰月之间的互动场景。屏幕中的水冰月保持施法准备姿势，双眼注视前方，嘴角微微上扬。接着，水冰月缓缓伸出右手，从屏幕平面中探出，手臂跨越虚拟与现实的边界，进入前景空间。她的手在真实人手的掌心上方悬停，手部在人手上投射出清晰的倒影。随后，水冰月的手指轻触人手掌心，接触瞬间，人手皮肤表面浮现出一道银色星光印记，印记随即开始闪烁，频率逐渐减缓，最终完全消失。虚拟人物的手与真实人手在空间位置与视觉层次上无缝衔接，呈现浑然一体的视觉效果。``` </details><details><summary>📷 Input image</summary> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd404df-18c8-4661-81d4-778f3159e742" width="600"></img></details>|<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e4eeb83-d350-4b04-aa29-50fd0454ac0f" width="600"> </video> <details><summary>📋 Show input prompt</summary> ```The camera remains static.
