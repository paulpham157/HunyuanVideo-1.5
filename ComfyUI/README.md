* **Important**: Workflows are still being updated. Please ensure you are using the latest version of the workflow templates to guarantee the best generation results.
* **Important**: The distilled models are CFG-distilled models rather than step-distilled models. Please run with 50 inference steps for best generation quality. The recommended configurations are provided in the following table.


### Recommended Inference Configurations

**Important!** The following table is for the best generation quality. If you want to generate faster, you can use the following configurations:


| Model | CFG Scale | Embedded CFG Scale | Flow Shift | Inference Steps |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| 480p T2V | 6 | None | 5 | 50 |
| 480p I2V | 6 | None | 5 | 50 |
| 720p T2V | 6 | None | 9 | 50 |
| 720p I2V | 6 | None | 7 | 50 |
| 480p T2V CFG Distilled | 1 | None | 5 | 50 |
| 480p I2V CFG Distilled | 1 | None | 5 | 50 |
| 720p T2V CFG Distilled | 1 | None | 9 | 50 |
| 720p I2V CFG Distilled | 1 | None | 7 | 50 |
| 720p T2V CFG Distilled Sparse | 1 | None | 9 | 50 |
| 720p I2V CFG Distilled Sparse | 1 | None | 7 | 50 |
| 480→720 SR Step Distilled | 1 | None | 2 | 6 |
| 720→1080 SR Step Distilled | 1 | None | 2 | 8 |
